# -Missionaries-and-cannibal-
Here is a Python implementation of the Missionaries and Cannibals problem, which solves the problem using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm.
The Missionaries and Cannibals problem is a classic AI challenge in state-space search and problem-solving. It involves safely transporting missionaries and cannibals across a river without violating constraints that would lead to missionaries being outnumbered and eaten. 

This problem serves as a fundamental example in artificial intelligence (AI) for exploring search algorithms, such as breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS), and heuristic-based approaches like A* search.

In AI, the problem is modeled as a state-space graph, where each state represents a valid configuration of missionaries, cannibals, and the boat on either side of the river. AI algorithms traverse this space efficiently to find an optimal solution. The problem's constraints make it ideal for studying intelligent decision-making, constraint satisfaction, and the trade-offs between computational efficiency and solution optimality.

This abstract highlights the significance of the Missionaries and Cannibals problem in AI education, demonstrating how such classical puzzles contribute to advancements in search strategies, heuristic design, and real-world applications in automated planning and robotics.
